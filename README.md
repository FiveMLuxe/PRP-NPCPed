# PRP-NPCPed
Place an NPC ped that is skinned as a player.

Another script I am releasing from our server - Custom ped placer.

This script will allow you to place an npc at coordinates, but you can make the ped be skinned as a player using the string of data from the users > skin data from the database!

Simply copy the data from the table and paste into the config. The NPC will look exactly like the player!

Also included is cd drawtext interacting with the NPC. I used this for a memorial event when a player died irl, so you can hug the NPC.

Open source, do whatever with it.
